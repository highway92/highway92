### Backend Engineer

- I started my career as a frontend Engineer but i'm working on backend side now.
The experience that working on both side makes me special that it helps me to have a good point of view if i get struggling on one problem.

- Putting lots of effort for making reasonable code and reusable code.
(I tried to review my code some time to time but everytime i check mine i blame myself lol... but that habbit helps me alot)

- Constantly learing something. My major was not a computer science. So i keep studying about hardware, networking or something else.
Thanks to many developers in whole world, now i can understand the structure of whole service not the code it self.
It's really important for me Cause i have to do some DevOps things too.

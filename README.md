### Backend Engineer

- I started my career as a frontend engineer, but now I am working on the backend side. The experience of working on both sides makes me special, as it helps me gain a well-rounded perspective when facing challenges or problems.

- Just want to be a fluent foreign language expert. Traveling to another countries always makes me happy. Plus the moment speak their language and share their cluture always gives me expanded view of my life.

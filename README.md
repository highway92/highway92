### Backend Engineer

- I started my career as a frontend engineer, but now I am working on the backend side. The experience of working on both sides makes me special, as it helps me gain a well-rounded perspective when facing challenges or problems.

- Putting in lots of effort to make the code both reasonable and reusable.
I tried to review my code from time to time, but every time I check it, I end up blaming myself lol... but that habbit helps me alot)

- Constantly learning something. My major was not computer science. So i keep studying about hardware, networking or something else.
Thanks to many developers around the world, I am now able to understand the structure of the entire service, rather than just the code itself.
